The core idea Of the HOG feature is that in an image, the appearance and shape of the local target can be well described by the gradient and the direction density of the edge (the statistical information of the gradient, while the gradient mainly exists at the edge). By dividing the whole image into several small connected cells and calculating the gradient or edge direction histogram of each cell, the combination of these histograms can be used to construct feature descriptors. In order to improve the accuracy, the local histogram can be compared and normalized in a larger scope of the image (called block). The method used is: first calculate the density of each histogram in the corresponding block, and then normalize all cells in the block according to this density. Normalization is more robust to light changes and shadows
